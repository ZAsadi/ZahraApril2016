Today I found out your git can have more than one remote.
remote set-URL [An existing remote name:origin and upstream are so common] [url]
If you are updating to use http your URL might look like :
https://github.com/username/otherrepostory.git

if you are updating to use SSH, your URL might look like:
git@github.com:/username/otherrepository.git

git remote -v
//lists all your remotes with their name
